Predicting Crop Production Based on Agricultural Data:

The main objective of this project is to predict crop-yield which can be extremely useful to farmers in planning for harvest and sale of grain. This project focuses on implementing a machine learning algorithm that gives better prediction of suitable crop for the corresponding region using previously collected datasets. This project aims to predict production based on agricultural data.

Problem Statement:

Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy, and accurately predicting crop production is essential for improving planning and decision-making. This project aims to develop a regression model that forecasts crop production (in tons) based on agricultural factors such as area harvested (in hectares), yield (in kg/ha), and the year, for various crops grown in a specific region.

Overview:

This project aims to predict crop production using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of crop yields based Area harvested,Yield,etc. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive models, farmers can make informed decisions to optimize crop production and maximize yields.

DataSet:

The dataset used for this project contains historical information about crop yields, focusing on crops such as Grapes and Wheat,etc, along with data on the year, area harvested, production, etc. Initially, the dataset was in Excel file which was preprocessed to remove missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for training machine learning models using Python.

Preprocessing:

Before training machine learning models, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps to ensure its suitability for model training. This included handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables. Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn were utilized for these preprocessing tasks.


Model Selection and Training:

Several machine learning algorithms were explored for predicting crop production, including linear regression, decision trees, Lasso, and KNeighbors Regressor. This models is trained on the preprocessed dataset using decision trees. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score.

Deployment:

Once a suitable model was identified, it was deployed for practical use. This involved integrating the model into a user-friendly interface or application where farmers could input relevant data and receive predictions for crop production based on their specific conditions.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the potential of machine learning techniques in predicting crop production and helping farmers make informed decisions to optimize their yields. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive models, farmers can improve their agricultural practices and contribute to food security and sustainability
